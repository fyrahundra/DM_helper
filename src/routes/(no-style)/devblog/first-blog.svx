# Hello üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Description

It is usually really hard for me to come up with ideas or start with a project. However this time around I already knew what I wanted to make since I had found it to be something I "needed" in my life.
So having made up my mind on what to make and how to prioritise the diffrent parts, I started with the page that would help with searching for diffrent dnd 5e monsters and spells.
For the most part I did this work myself, except for for example how to make the svg I wanted (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10177985/svg-rounded-corner), but when I needed help and could not easaly find it on the intenet I would ask chatGPT for help.

## Changes

The following changes and implementations have been made in this version of the project:

* The fetch function for spells and monsters. (https://www.dnd5eapi.co) 
    * Button to switch between spells and monster and the logic behind it.
* The generall structuring and styling for the layout and the search page (spells and monsters).
* Nested array for the fetched results made in order to use a custom alternative to overfill-y: scroll;.

## Features

‚úÖ API for search page.

‚úÖ Details for selected monster or spell.
