# Hello Again üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Description

Since last time I have done a lot of work. I have completed most of the work for the notes and search pages and have begun working on the NPC-generator. 
For the most part I have worked on my own however, like before, I have used ChatGPT when I have been completly lost and not gotten help from my internet searches.
I am really hopeful that I will be able to complete this project but am aware that I might have to sacrifice some of the more complex functionality.

## Changes

The following changes and implementations have been made in this version of the project:

* The search page is complete (might add some things later but all the functionality is there).
    * It is possible to filter the monsters and spells from a pop-up menu.
    * Clicking a spell or monster makes a "card" appear with some information on it.
* The note page is also complete, however there is still some functionality I would like to add.
* Work on the NPC-generator has started and some functionality had been implemented however there is much left.

## New Features

‚úÖ Possiblety to save and load notes in the note page + the abillity to write notes (textarea)

‚úÖ Animation for the "card" in the search page

‚úÖ Randomized stats for the NPC in the NPC-generator

‚úÖ Implemented API for the NPC-generator for future features
